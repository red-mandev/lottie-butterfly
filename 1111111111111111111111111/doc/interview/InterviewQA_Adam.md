My salary expectation is negotiable. Based on my technical skills and years of experience and my research on the current
market, I’m looking for a base salary roughly between 140k and 170k for annual.

# What are you looking for in your next role?
Three things that I'm looking for in my next job are a collaborative, team-focused culture, opportunities to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more leadership skills over time. 

# What is the professional achievement you’re most proud of? What is your greatest accomplishment?
In my most recent role, a former coworker left his job unexpectedly. During this time, he was on an important new project. When he left, my manager asked me to take it over. They were working with mobile apps and I have no experience with android. Using my programming and problem-solving skills, I pushed the project forward, encouraged the rest of the team and completed his responsibilities as well as mine. We were able to complete this project successfully and on deadline.

# What kind of project have you worked on?
In my career as a software engineer, I've had the opportunity to contribute to a range of projects that span both mobile applications and full-stack development. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based frameworks for frontend development and Java and PHP frameworks for backend development.
And also Java and Kotlin for mobile apk development.

# What are your strengths/weaknesses?
My greatest strength as a software engineer is my programming and problem-solving skills.

Proficient in multiple programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and so on, I bring a wealth of experience in the entire software development lifecycle. And my problem-solving skills shine when faced with complex challenges.

In my most recent role, a former coworker left his job unexpectedly. During that time, he was on an important new project. When he left, my manager asked me to take it over. They were working with mobile apps and I have not much experience with android. His project was a theme changer app and it has a lot of features. Using my programming and problem-solving skills, I finished it completely and successfully.


The weakest trait I struggled with wasn't asking for help. I always try to solve my own problems instead of asking a co-worker who might know the answer. This would save me more time and I would be more efficient. I'm working on knowing when it would be beneficial to ask for help.

# Why should we hire you?
During my career, I could learn a lot, gain valuable experience and I’ve gradually taken on more and more responsibility. At first, I was responsible of creating solid front-ends providing a good user experience and this helped me to become more detail-oriented and get a better sense of user experience design. Later, I was gradually involved in the backend development, which allowed me to possess good mastery of web architecture and general infrastructure, as well as database design and performance optimization techniques. I could also bring my mentoring skills to a new level while providing guidance to junior members. I would love the opportunity to use my skills for this position.
I’m confident I can improve the software even better in terms of scalability and performance, with my expert knowledge and experience. 

# What is your career goal?
My career goal is to move into a management role such as a tech lead or staff software engineer, once I have mastered all aspects of the software engineering role.
I want to contribute as much as I can to the business while working as a senior software engineer. However, once I have mastered all aspects of this role I see myself moving into a management role such as a tech lead or staff software engineer. I’m a leader and incredibly organized as I have demonstrated in previous roles.

In five years, I see myself as a successful software engineer who has benefited the business and achieved my technical goals. I enjoy new challenges and am eager to move up in the company into a specialized role where I can focus on the more technical problems we face and make a real difference.

# Where do you see yourself in next five years

The most crucial aspect of being a leader, in my view, is about inspiring a shared vision, fostering a positive culture, and empowering each team member. It's about effective communication, adaptability, and creating an environment where everyone feels valued and motivated. I think these are the most important things to be a leader.

# Which environment do you prefer? Team or Individual?
I prefer to work with a team. In a team setting, collaboration often sparks creativity, allows for diverse perspectives, and fosters collective problem-solving. It's an environment where ideas can be refined through discussion, and each team member contributes their unique expertise.

# Why do you want to work remotely?
Working remotely allows me to grow my skills and experience effectively while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. I can skip traffic and avoid delays due to weather conditions, which gives me more hours daily that I can dedicate to my job. Working from home would also save the company space as it would require one less desk and will save money on electricity.

Behavioral Questions
# Give an example of how you have handled a challenge in the workplace before.
When I was working at Amazon, our team leader has diagnosed with COVID-19 and he stopped working. It was a very serious problem for us because we were almost near the deadline and we couldn't stop the project. Our team was a newly grouped team with less experienced engineers. I was the one who pushed the project forward so I had a chance to manage the project and lead the team. But at that time my leadership skill was very poor. We worked hard and together to finish the project and they support me well to manage the project. As a result, we completed the project successfully and met the deadline. Our manager was very proud of us. I can't think of the success without the support of the team members. Later we worked well and developed and updated many websites together helping each other.


# Have you ever done pair programming, and what do you think of it?
I have been following the pair programming for over 3 years and I know it has a number of advantages. Some benefits we can expect from pair programming are better code, shared knowledge throughout the team, better time management, and higher productivity.
When we work together on a single problem at one workstation, we can get more diverse solutions to the problems because we bring different experiences and have different ways to understand the problem.
Code is getting reviewed continuously so we get the confidence in our deliverables. And also the knowledge will be constantly shared between them and while reviewing the code and providing feedback, we can increase our ability a lot.


# Tell me about a mistake you made while working as a software developer. How did you handle it?
When I was working at Amazon, our team leader was diagnosed with COVID-19 and he stopped working. It was a very serious problem for us because we were almost near the deadline and we couldn't stop the project. Our team was a newly grouped team with less experienced engineers. I was the one who pushed the project forward so I had a chance to manage the project and lead the team. But during that time, I made some mistakes with version controlling because I have no experience with managing the project at the top. With my understanding of git I made many mistakes and wasted a lot of time to fix that. I started by dedicating time to self-educate on version control systems, attending online courses, and seeking guidance from more experienced colleagues. I also asked other team leaders to handle the issues and manage the project. I took a long time to get to the right workflow. But in the end, we finished the project successfully on time and I got a lot of experience during the time.


# Tell me about a time when you disagreed with your boss.
When I was working at Amazon, one day during the standup, my boss asked me to add a select form to the page to show the status of the employees and he asked me to finish that in an hour. It looks easy but it was a complex project and the website was entirely built with Java and JSP, without relying on any external framework. And the workflow of the project was too complicated and also I wasn't that familiar with Java and JSP and also I had to edit the database. 
After the standup, I asked to speak with him privately, and told him that it took more than 3 hours to finish the whole feature like show, insert, update, and delete. We deeply discussed that feature and found the best way to complete it fast. In the end, he asked me to finish it in 3 hours and I finished it perfectly in 2 hours. The small disagreement with my boss solved frequently and we became closer.


# What kind of work environment do you like best?
I like fast-paced work environments because they make me feel like I’m always learning and growing, but I really thrive when I’m collaborating with team members and helping people reach a collective goal as opposed to competing.


# Tell me about a time you completed a project and your customer didn’t like it. How did you handle it?
When I was working with a mobile app, our customer asked us to change the feature and layout of the app. We used activities to show the features but the customer asked us to change them to fragments in the same deadline. We told him that it's not a small change and we have to change the whole structure of the app and it took more than 3 days to change all of that. We discussed it for a long time and finally postponed the deadline by 3 days. It wasn't so easy to change whole features but we all worked hard and met the deadline.
