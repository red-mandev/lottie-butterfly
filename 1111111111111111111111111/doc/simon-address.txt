Practical experience in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including Agile/SCRUM and Waterfall


In Next.js, I have experience with 4 years, As a Full Stack Developer, it's 7 years

Shortly, We sometimes use Next for SEO 
With this, Backend is Spring Boot
There are two problems.
First is SEO, so we can use getInitialProps  function,
Second is routing, I use previous framework-React, but when I start to use next, it's different in routing side.

Next.js provides built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR), which can improve the SEO performance of web applications by ensuring search engines can properly crawl and index the content.

As a backend, I always use Express.js, But it's big project or need a high performance
I shortly designed REST API with Database


Some common considerations when working with RESTful APIs and microservices include ensuring API consistency, managing service dependencies, minimizing latency, handling complex error scenarios, and coordinating synchronous communication between services.


I always use SQL within E-commerce
